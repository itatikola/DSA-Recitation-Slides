# CS 1332 Recitation Slides
I'm a teaching assistant for the Data Structures & Algorithms course at my school. Our course regularly has the largest enrollment in the entire university with well over 1000 students per semester. 
We offer weekly recitations taught by the TA's on top of lectures by the professors. This past spring, I created recitation slides every week. I hope these slides can help students everywhere understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms a little better. Enjoy!

As always, please reach out if you see errors anywhere!!
